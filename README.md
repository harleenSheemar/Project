🚀 Project Overview
This project dives into the analysis and prediction of real estate listings data using Python and Power BI. The pipeline involves:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing
Classification model building using Logistic Regression
Visual storytelling with Power BI

📁 File Descriptions
📘 EDA Project.ipynb
This notebook performs initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
i. Describes the dataset structure
ii. Visualizes distributions and correlations
iii. Highlights missing values and outliers
iv. Useful for understanding the data before modeling

📗 classification.ipynb
This file focuses on Logistic Regression Classification:
1. Prepares features and labels (binary classification)
2. Applies logistic regression without converting any numerical features to categorical
3. Includes model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

📙 listingsML.ipynb
This is a continuation of model development on the listings dataset:

More advanced machine learning pipelines
Feature selection and backward elimination
Data standardization and grid search
Suitable for building and testing robust models

📊 Cleaned.pbix
Power BI dashboard file:

Visualizes insights from the cleaned dataset
Includes interactive charts for price analysis, location-based filtering, and more
Ideal for non-technical stakeholders to understand data patterns

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
Jupyter Notebooks
Power BI Desktop
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Feature Engineering
Data Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📈 Results and Visualizations
EDA showed strong relationships between price, location, and availability
Logistic Regression model achieved acceptable accuracy with clear decision boundaries
Power BI dashboard reveals trends in pricing and occupancy visually

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete data science pipeline for real estate data, from raw exploration to insightful dashboards. It is suitable for educational, analytical, and real-world application development purposes
